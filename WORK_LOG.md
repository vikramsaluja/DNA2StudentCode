| Oct 16  | 1:00-1:45pm |            Orginally, I know that I can solve this probem a similar way to solving it how we did in cs1. This would mean comparing a set of letters to the next set and see if it reoccuring. Then by end your could return the number the number with the most comparisons. One way that I am starting to think about approaching this would be if I could implement a trie or TST in someway to have a constant look up with each of the reoccuring sequences. I'm not too sure how this would work though but I am just trying to think of ways that I could cut down the run time. |
| Oct 16  | 6:00-7:15pm | I tried to continue to think about how I could possibly use a trie or tst but ended up getting stuck. Instead I thinking about if I can use an to then avoid checking overlapping regions of DNA over and over again. I think this would make the orginal cs1 approach to the problem more efficent but I am not sure if that is a strong change in the actual approach to this problem. Once I figured this out I am wondering if there is a way to take the desired sequence and then go through and try and find matches within the sequence so I would only need to make one pass. |
| Oct 19  | 7:00-8:00pm |                                                                      I think that this could be more efficient if I am able to make a comparison between the desired sequence that I am looking for the and then compare it with the rest of DNA sequence. Though I am not entirely sure how I would actually code this or if my logic makes sense, so far I think that this could be a possibilty. The one issue that I think might occur with this approach is going back and not just moving on but realzing that another sequence can start previous to the end of the one before. |
