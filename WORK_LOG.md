| Oct 16  | 1:00-1:45pm | Orginally, I know that I can solve this probem a similar way to solving it how we did in cs1. This would mean comparing a set of letters to the next set and see if it reoccuring. Then by end your could return the number the number with the most comparisons. One way that I am starting to think about approaching this would be if I could implement a trie or TST in someway to have a constant look up with each of the reoccuring sequences. I'm not too sure how this would work though but I am just trying to think of ways that I could cut down the run time.  |
